# braintrust
to run, add your `BRAINTRUST_API_KEY` to your `.env` file and run `npx ts-node download_project.ts`.

## testing
example csv files are in the `local_projects/Explorations` directory; `Explorations` was my mock project name.

`mock-setup` was used to populate my braintrust account with mock data for testing.
